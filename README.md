🎓 Nirmaan AI Communication Evaluator🚀 OverviewThe Nirmaan AI Evaluator is an automated assessment tool designed to analyze student spoken introductions. It combines Rule-Based Logic (for structure and pacing) with NLP Semantic Analysis (for content relevance) to generate a rubric-aligned proficiency score (0-100).This tool addresses the Nirmaan Case Study requirement for an automated scoring system that provides granular, actionable feedback.🧠 Scoring Formula & LogicThe system evaluates transcripts against an 8-point weighted rubric, identical to the case study requirements.CriterionWeightScoring Logic1. Salutation5%Rule-Based: Checks for formal ("Good morning") vs. enthusiastic ("Excited to be here") vs. basic ("Hi") greetings.2. Keywords30%NLP (Semantic): Uses Cosine Similarity (Sentence-Transformers) to detect key concepts (Name, Family, Hobbies) even if exact words are missing.3. Flow5%Structural: Verifies the logical sequence: Salutation → Name → Details → Closing.4. Speech Rate10%Math: Calculates Words Per Minute (WPM). • Ideal: 111-140 WPM • Fast/Slow: Penalized based on deviation.5. Grammar10%Heuristic: Analyzes sentence capitalization and punctuation structure as a proxy for grammatical correctness.6. Vocabulary10%Statistical: Calculates Type-Token Ratio (TTR) to measure lexical diversity (unique words vs total words).7. Clarity15%Pattern Matching: Detects the density of filler words (um, uh, like, you know) to assess fluency.8. Engagement15%Sentiment Analysis: Uses TextBlob to measure the polarity of the text (Positive/Enthusiastic vs. Neutral/Flat).🛠️ Tech StackFrontend: Streamlit (Python)NLP Engine: sentence-transformers (Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2)Sentiment Engine: TextBlobData Visualization: Plotly ExpressData Processing: Pandas📦 Quick Start (Local)Clone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nirmaan-ai-evaluator.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nirmaan-ai-evaluator.git)
